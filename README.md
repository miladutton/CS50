Harvard CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python

Welcome to my repository of problem sets from Harvard's CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python! This course provided a comprehensive introduction to the fundamentals of programming and computational thinking using Python.

Certificate of Completion

I successfully completed the course, and you can view my certificate here.

Repository Overview

This repository contains all the problem sets I completed during the course. Each problem set focuses on a different aspect of Python programming, building on skills such as:

Variables and Data Types

Loops and Conditionals

Functions and Modules

File I/O

Object-Oriented Programming

Exception Handling

Data Structures and Algorithms

File Structure

Each problem set is organized in its respective folder by week, with a clear naming convention for easy navigation. Here is an example structure:

|-- Week 1
|   |-- problem1.py
|-- Week 2
|   |-- problem2.py
|-- Week 3
|   |-- problem3.py
