# Harvard CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python

Welcome to my repository of problem sets from Harvard's CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python! This course provided a comprehensive introduction to the fundamentals of programming and computational thinking using Python.

## Certificate of Completion

I successfully completed the course, and you can view my certificate [here](https://certificates.cs50.io/e7a24bb4-d9e4-4181-857d-371315c0a44f.pdf?size=letter).

## Repository Overview

This repository contains all the problem sets I completed during the course. Each problem set focuses on a different aspect of Python programming, building on skills such as:

- Variables and Data Types
- Loops and Conditionals
- Functions and Modules
- File I/O
- Object-Oriented Programming
- Exception Handling
- Data Structures and Algorithms

## File Structure

Each problem set is organized in its respective folder by week, with a clear naming convention for easy navigation. Here is an example structure:
